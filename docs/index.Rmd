# All Thingz Schwemz

"So far as the theories of mathematics are about reality, they are not certain; so far as they are certain, they are not about reality."

  **-Albert Einstein**

"Calculus required continuity, and continuity required the idea of the infinitely little, but nobody could discover what the infinitely little might be." 

  **-Bertrand Russell**
